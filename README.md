Node.js - mars
================

Tag steps in your code and navigate to them using Git.


Why?
----

Live coding demos can sometimes suck for noob-presenters. This makes it a lot better.



Installation
------------

    npm install -g mars



Example
------

Docs later. Let me use it during my first presentation in a week, and I'll know how well it works.
