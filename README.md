Node.js - mars
================

Tag steps in your code and navigate to them using Git.


Why?
----

Live coding demos can sometimes suck for noob-presenters. This makes it a lot better.



Installation
------------

    npm install -g mars



How
---

Mars works by leveraging the power of Git tags and Git's checkout functionality. What you need to do is build your demo and at points that you want to demo, simply execute `mars-tag`.
